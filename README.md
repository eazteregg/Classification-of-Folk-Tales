# Classification-of-Folk-Tales
This program will eventually be able to automatically classify archetypes of folk tale characters. At the moment though,
all it can do is resolve the coreferences in a given text using Stanford CoreNLP.

In order to run this you need to download nltk, pexpect for python and the Stanford Corenlp java utility.
The latter you may download at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/. The program was built using the 3.7.0 version.
Furthermore, the downloaded folder is expected to be within the project directory.
